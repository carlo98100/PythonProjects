# Many different python projects
## Hangman ##
This project is a digital version of the classic game "Hangman." The objective is for the user to guess a letter that is part of the final word. The word to be guessed is hidden behind question marks. As a player, you have 5 attempts before you ultimately lose. It's a fun and straightforward game that you could easily expand upon if you wished.

## Guess the number
This project is a game where you have to guess a number between 1 - 100 (although I'd recommend lowering the number to make the game easier to win). It's a simple yet enjoyable game with many different aspects you can develop further if you choose to do so.
